I approve most of the corrections. However, I do not approve of certain changes and the following changes must be made. This is followed by my response to your specific questions at the end of the manuscript.

1) Footnote #20: Remove the hyphen in the acronym. The acronym must be CAASTRO and not CAAS-TRO

2) Page 3, text following equation 6: The value and units of H0 cannot be split between multiple lines. Thus H_0 = 100 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1} must appear in the same line. This applies to all physical quantities and their units in this paper.

3) Last sentence of second paragraph in section 4.2, it should be specified as "170 MHz" instead of just "170"

4) In fifth paragraph in section 5, neither RA nor declination can be split between two lines. Thus R.A.=0^$\textrm{h}$ and decl.=-30\arcdeg each should not be split over two lines.

5) Last sentence of second paragraph in section 5.3, the "%" sign should be specified after "70" as "70%". 

6) In the last sentence of the paragraph that begins with "In other words..." in section 6, the "%" sign should be specified after "5" as "5%". 

7) The second line after equation B3 is awkwardly space. It is acceptable to change the order in which H_0 and E(z) are mentioned in the second and third lines in the text following equation B3 if that helps get rid of this awkward spacing. For instance, both "H_0 and E(z)... are standard terms in cosmology" and "E(z)... and H_0 are standard terms in cosmology" are acceptable.

8) The reference Offringa et al.(2015) should be updated from arXiv specifier to "Offringa, A. R., Wayth, R. B., Hurley-Walker, N., et al. 2015, PASA, 32, 8".

Response to specific questions at end of manuscript:

Q1: The full name of author in Pober et al.(2015) is Jonathan C. Pober. 

Q2: I could not find the publisher details for Taylor et al.(1999) from the NASA ADS or any other source. This is perhaps because it is not a book but rather a summary of conference proceedings. The ADS link for this reference can be found here: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ASPC..180.....T

Q3: All journal references have links.
